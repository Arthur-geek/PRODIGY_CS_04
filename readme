Dependencies
    The program uses the pynput library to capture keyboard events. Ensure you have this library installed:

    pip install pynput


Log File
    The keylogger records keystrokes in a file named keylog.txt.

Functions
    on_press(key)
    Handles key press events and logs the keys to keylog.txt.

Parameters:
    key: The key that was pressed.
    Functionality:
    If the key is a standard character, it logs the character.
    If the key is a special key (e.g., space, enter), it logs the key name.

    on_release(key)
    Handles key release events and stops the keylogger if the Esc key is pressed.

    Parameters:

    key: The key that was released.
    Functionality:

    If the Esc key is pressed, the function returns False, stopping the listener.

Main Function
    Sets up the keylogger listener and starts it.

Functionality:
    Initializes the listener to call on_press for key press events and on_release for key release events.
    The listener runs indefinitely until stopped by pressing the Esc key.

Usage
    Run the Program: Execute the script to start logging keystrokes.
    Stopping the Keylogger: Press the Esc key to stop the keylogger.
    Viewing Logs: Open the keylog.txt file to view the recorded keystrokes.

Ethical Considerations
    Permissions: Always ensure you have explicit permission from the user or owner of the device before running a keylogger.
    Legal Compliance: Be aware of the legal implications and ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations.
